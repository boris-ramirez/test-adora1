      "Every age has its challenges. The challenges of the 21st century are much more global in nature, from the COVID-19 pandemic to climate change, and demand much broader visions than previously conceived in former centuries. The institutions and systems of the 21st century do not meet the needs and exigencies of an increasingly interdependent global society that is suffering the consequences of ecological destruction, which impact population health and wellbeing.  A planetary perspective for the challenges of the 21st century may provide a conceptual framework for action towards a world that is healthier, more just and equitable in the 21st century.",

In this talk we will explore how changes within the Arctic are affecting the people living there, why past methods of adaptation are struggling to keep up with this change, and how some new efforts in the region  may prove to be an important model for the rest of the planet when we try to build a more sustainable world.",

She is fascinated by the complex relationship between humans and our environment, how different experiences and forms  of knowledge can teach us much about the world around us, and how we can use this diversity of perspectives to build a better and more sustainable future.",

What do we need to do to save them?",

He dove on many of the world's great reefs before their decline began, and spent  two weeks as an aquanaut living at the bottom of a coral reef. He chose the coral reef ecosystem as his research subject to try to understand unity in diversity as expressed in nature. His career was then devoted to building environmental cooperation at the  regional and global levels. As a systems scientist, he now applies the same principles to the challenges of managing the global environment.",

    description:
      "As an industry, software development is brimming with altruistic professionals with strong ethical orientations and a desire to be of service.  At the same time, the software industry provides the enabling tissue that makes the degradation of our environment possible and aggravates the polarisation of our societies. How can we harness the collective altruism and strategic position of software engineers for climate action? How do we coordinate for maximum impact? Where do global institutions fit? Can we aggregate into a net force for good?",
    bio: "Ismael Velasco is a Software Engineer building web applications in sectors including education, fintech, mental health and the public sector. His initiative for crowd sourcing resources during the peak of the pandemic won the Global Hack prize for Solidarity and Empowerment out of 1000+ projects entered by 10,000 innovators. He founded the Adora Foundation in 2012 and has worked in 20+ countries in the areas of sustainability, resilience education and values and behaviour change.",

      "Creating collective engineering climate standards - for the good of all",
    description:
      "Climate change is an engineering challenge. Engineers training today will see changes in agriculture, land use, civil planning requirements, water availability and mass human migration as the scale of the climate crisis becomes manifest. Each of these are engineering challenges that will call engineers to bring their skills and ingenuity to bear in ways that we currently can't predict. \n" +
      'Engineering is fundamentally an enabling activity. It enables individuals, companies and communities to do this that would be beyond impossible without the skills and practices that engineers bring. With this vital role, comes an equally important responsibility to ask "what should we enable?"\n' +
      "Since many of the causes of climate change have been enabled by engineers, it is now more important than ever that we take stock of the role of the engineering profession on the wellbeing of humanity and the common global home. \n" +
      "Key to establishing how engineers should be guided, supported, encouraged and required to act, is to recognise that engineers have a powerful voice and opportunity when acting collectively. The strength of a formal profession is that it can author and establish rules that limit its practice and benefit society. In this they can take inspiration from The Declaration of Helsinki, created by the medical profession for the profession, to hold physicians to a higher standard of ethical conduct than was found in the legal framework of individual countries.",
    bio: "Dr Helen Morley started as an electronic engineer before pursuing a PhD in Engineering Ethics at the University of Leeds, UK. Her work has included teaching ethics to engineers, working with Engineers Without Borders and co-organising an ethics and climate change event with the Royal Academy of Engineers. Her research focused on understanding how engineers can be supported in making ethical decisions. In 2017 she co-authored a paper on engineering ethics and climate change.",
